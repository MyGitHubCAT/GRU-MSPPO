# GRU-MSPPO
Partial simulation results of GRU-MSPPO.

We have shared a demo containing part of the environment and simulation results. However, to ensure flexibility for future research, the provided content is for reference only.
If you encounter any issues, please feel free to contact us via email.

The demo briefly constructs a framework for the battery swapping process in a BSS, where the environment is controlled through the generated GM object. At each stage, the environment state can be analyzed and corresponding reward values can be computed as needed.
As for the model, we provide the network structure and partial pre-trained parameters for result display purposes.
(Note: As the research progresses, some information may be updated accordingly, and related results may change. We warmly welcome further communication and discussion. 405648708@sjtu.edu.cn)
